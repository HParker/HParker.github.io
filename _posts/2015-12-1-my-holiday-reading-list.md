I thought I would share my reading list for this holiday season:

* [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope)

Language internals have always been interesting to me and after
watching Aaron Patterson's
[Inside Ruby's VM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT8JSJkymZM) talk,
I thought it might be time to explore in more detail

* [Exceptional Ruby](http://exceptionalruby.com/)

I have had this one on my list for a while. I think understanding when
and why to raise what exceptions is more important than the amount of
time I have put into it.

* [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)

I read enough of this book in college to write a paper on it. At this
point I need to start new to finish it properly.

* [The Fountainhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead)

This book along with the book above come from a life syllabus
published by one of my favorite professors. I honestly don't know a
ton about the book, but I hope experiencing it that way is better.

* [The little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer) & [the structure and interpretation of computer programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

I have a little bit of scheme experience from back in college, but while going through some clojure books, I became interested in some of the more historical (maybe pure or true lisp would be appropriate, but inflammatory)


I have also added a Reading, Read section on the [about](/about) page.
