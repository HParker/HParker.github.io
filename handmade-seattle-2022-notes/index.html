I collected a few notes on some of my favorites, though I invite you to watch all of the talks.</p><p><strong>Weathering Software Winter</strong> - <a href=https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devine_lu_linvega.html>Devine</a> always has inspiring and visually stunning talks. Seeing more of the inspiration behind the <a href=https://100r.co/site/uxn.html>Uxn virtual machine</a> inspires me to also pull inspiration from history. His ideas around e-waste, preservation and doing more with less are under appreciated areas to focus in an industry that wants to reinvent everything all the time.</p><p><strong>Compexity: Why Can&rsquo;t We Make Simple Software</strong> - <a href=https://twitter.com/pvh>Peter Van Hardenberg</a> did an excellent job explaining software complexity and the ways that it manifests without blame! It is a very easy trap to fall in as an engineer to think that complexity is a problem created by other engineers &ndash; or your past self, but instead Peter frames it as a necessary part of the system which must be tolerated and managed.
He mentions how better tools can&rsquo;t save us from complexity, but only allows us to tolerate more complexity before it feels painful. I wish he had said how amazing that is. Tools making software that was previously painful to express simpler is an amazing feat!
I think he also did a good job reminding people that removing complexity by starting over can be a way to avoid complexity, but only temporarily. Complexity is a feature of a system that is valuable!</p><p><strong>EmberGen</strong> - At least watch this talk for the explosions! I also think that this is one of the best interviews at the conference. The speaker did an amazing job explaining EmberGen and how to approach technical problems with a focused and methodical approach that seems worth emulating.</p><p><strong>RSM, a little virtual computer</strong> - I am a sucker for virtual machines. <a href=https://rsms.me/rsm/>RSM</a> has some interesting properties especially around scheduling and memory management. These properties probably make RMS appropriate for more complicated problems at the cost of also being more complicated itself &ndash; though still simple compared to other virtual machines.
Compared with Uxn, it is nice that it has a concept of registers and coroutine style multi-threading. I wouldn&rsquo;t want these things in Uxn, but it is great that there is a similar project with these properties to play with.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://www.hparker.xyz title="By Adam Hess"><small>By Adam Hess</small></a></div></div></body></html>
