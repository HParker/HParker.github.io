# Invoca Hackathon

I participated in a hackathon at Invoca where we where give 2 days to build and present a project of our choosing. I won most technical project for my adaptation of a very simple RISC game written in Elm

The project is a small assembly-like programing language that only
knows a few primitives. From this you are able to program a small
fictional "chip" to do simple tasks like increment or sum numbers
together. The programing concept is that inputs come from the left and
output to the right. You also have two registers one of which you can
write to directly and one that you can only swap your register
with. Given more time, I would consider adding additional puzzles and
adding additional instructions to make the game more
interesting. Right now I consider it a very, very simple RISC style
game that needs many more features to make it unique and valuable as a
game. As a hackathon project it was very successful and quite
interesting.
