Hey, This is Adam. I am a software developer. I work mostly in Ruby
and Javascript, but I have a latent interest in compiler design and implementation. I also drink far
much coffee.

## Reading:

* [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope)
* [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/)
* [The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning/dp/1732265178)

## Next to read:

* [Writing a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/)

* [Exceptional Ruby](http://exceptionalruby.com/) Short and had a
couple nuggets of knowledge. The points of reflection where a bit
weak, but the quotes and cited books where good and I am excited to
read them.  FYI: if you use iBooks, the epub will not render
correctly, so I wasn't able to make notes. Also, you'll have to read
past the typos.

* [the structure and interpretation of computer programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

* [The Little Go Book](http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/) I
Highly recommend this book if you are at all interested in go. The
author is super awesome and open to feedback.

* [POODR](http://www.poodr.com/) Sandi Metz is a demigod around the
  office.
