Hey, This is Adam. I am a software developer. I work mostly in Ruby
and Javascript, but I have a latent interest in LISP. I drink far too
much coffee and enjoy Pho.

## Reading:

## Next to read:

## Recently Read:

* [Exceptional Ruby](http://exceptionalruby.com/) Short and had a
couple nuggets of knowledge. The points of reflection where a bit
weak, but the quotes and cited books where good and I am excited to
read them.  FYI: if you use iBooks, the epub will not render
correctly, so I wasn't able to make notes. Also, you'll have to read
past the typos.


* [The Little Go Book](http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/)I
Highly recommend this book if you are at all interested in go. The
author is super awesome and open to feedback.

* [POODR](http://www.poodr.com/) Sandi Metz is a demigod around the
  office.
