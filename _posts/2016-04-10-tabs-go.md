title: Turns out I like tabs in Go

So, it turns out tabs are actually kinda nice. I assumed that I would
dislike tabs in Go as much as I dislike tabs in any other
language. I was wrong. Until working in Go, I would have
cited a number of reasons I don't like tabs. they are too big, they
are magic nothing that is different from the other magic nothing spots
you have in your editor and they look different on different
computers.

A little magic `(setq tab-width 2)` and `(add-hook 'before-save-hook
'gofmt-before-save)` and my code looks just like I like it. The best
part is I don't have to think about it again. I am using tabs, but I
don't care. Everything just looks like I want it to. Someone else
seeing my code may prefer 8 space indent and they can have it. `gofmt`
prevents debates. Instead we can debate architecture and interfaces.

Go's overall "consistency over perfection" attitude towards style lets me
forget about style almost entirely. I think most of what people want
out of style is consistency and coming to consensus on a team is much
harder than having it laid down by the language.

I think seeing Go's treatment of style has helped me better understand
what I want from code style and tempered my willingness to debate
it. This is what I like about tabs in Go, I don't have to think about
them at all.
